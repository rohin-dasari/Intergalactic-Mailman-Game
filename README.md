# Intergalactic Mailman
This is a simple arcade game that uses your face as a controller. You're (as the title says) an intergalactic mailman, who has to avoid the meteors and pick up loose pieces of mail as you go. Every piece of mail you pick up increases your score by 1 and every meteor that you hit decreases your score by 1. The game is made in pygame and all of the face tracking is done through dlib. OpenCV was used for processing the images.

# Motivation
This game was developed as a possible method for people with disabilities to be able to play games without physical controllers.
